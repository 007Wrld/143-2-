					Happy Monthsary lovey!ü•∞ And Merry Christmas too po. I don't really know how or where to start, theres a lot of things I wanna say but at the same time I also dont know how to say those things‚ò∫Ô∏è. Anyway let me start by saying that this is coming straight from my heart, not from chatgpt or rizz app thing oki? Hahahahaha. But yeah seriously I just wanna thank you love. I just want you to know how happy and grateful I am to have you in my life.YOU ARE TRULY A BLESSING. And I appreciate everything you do for us, for me. Every moment we share, every conversation, every laugh, even every quiet moment when youre dyeing in reveü§≠, I treasure it all. Thank you for staying and for giving me the chance to grow and be the man I should and I want to be, especially for you. I know the distance between us sometimes makes things hard, and it makes you doubt a lot of things but please trust in me po, trust in us. This distance aint got nothing on us. I promise you everything we are going through will be worth it. It will all be worth it in God's perfect time. I love you more than words can say Ha. You are everything to me. You are the reason why I have a dream. YOU ARE MY DREAM. You are my heart. You are the reason why I wake up with a smile in my face every morning. I love you love. I LOVE YOU HA. I love you so much. Happy monthsarry and merry Christmas po lovey.‚ù§Ô∏è
